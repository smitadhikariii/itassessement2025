            <h1>About SoulsDen</h1>
            <p>SoulsDen is a fan-made project about the iconic Souls series and the Souls-like games: the predecessors of Souls games. This site was created as a university project to appreciate the creativity, challenge, and immersive world design these games offer.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>To provide an informative, stylish hub for fellow fans who enjoy the punishing but rewarding gameplay and combat of games like Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro, and more.</p>
            
            <h2>Created By</h2>
            <p>This website was made by Smit Adhikari as part of a university assignment. I'm not a professional developer, just someone who really enjoys these games and wanted to share the love and passion to others.</p>
